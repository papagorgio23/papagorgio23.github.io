## A.I. Sports

Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to predict the game.

At A.I. Sports, our core is built around statistical techniques to predict the probability of athletic outcomes. Our belief in complex, deep learning models leads us to discover statistical anomalies that simpler mathematical models fail to properly attribute. Our goal is to provide viable information to help you locate the weakness in basic predictors and exploit them to validate your investments.

Sports investing has long been a “predictor model,” with the assumption that one’s ability to correctly guess outcomes is the only important characteristic. At A.I. Sports, we value both prediction accuracy as well as under-appreciated lines, by determining the prediction’s value against the market’s evaluation. To us, it’s about both accuracy and price, with the goal to discover value within an over-saturated market. This is why we provide you with the tools to learn our strategies and recreate our techniques on your own.

In an investment world dominated by “talking heads” and “hot picks,” we strive to stand out by giving you insight into the math, logic, and modeling behind the suggestions. So without further ado, welcome to A.I. Sports! Please poke around our website. We have everything from interactive apps to a “How to Build Your First Model” series. And, as always, if you want to “beat the system,” you must first understand the system. Enjoy!
